What is Servlet in Java?

A Servlet in Java is a server-side component that extends the capabilities of a web server. It receives and responds to HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers, and dynamically generates web content. Servlets are used to handle business logic, process form data, interact with databases, and generate dynamic web pages.
