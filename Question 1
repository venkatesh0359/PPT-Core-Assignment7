 What is the use of JDBC in Java?

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable developers to perform various database operations, such as connecting to a database, executing SQL queries, and manipulating data. JDBC acts as a bridge between the Java application and the database, allowing seamless communication and data retrieval.
