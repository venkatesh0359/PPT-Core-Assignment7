What are the limitations of JSP?


Despite their advantages, JSP (JavaServer Pages) have some limitations:

Mixing Logic and Presentation: JSPs can lead to mixing business logic with presentation, which violates the principles of good software design. Over time, this can result in maintenance issues and reduced code readability.

Steep Learning Curve: JSP can have a steeper learning curve for beginners compared to basic HTML or client-side technologies like JavaScript and CSS.

Performance Overhead: JSP pages can incur performance overhead, especially for complex applications, due to the additional translation steps required to convert JSP pages into servlets before execution.

Limited Reusability: Without proper design and separation of concerns, JSPs may become tightly coupled with specific use cases, reducing their reusability across the application.

Debugging Complexity: Debugging JSP pages can be more challenging than debugging pure Java code since JSP combines Java and HTML syntax.

To overcome some of these limitations, developers often adopt the MVC architecture or use frameworks like Spring MVC, which provides better separation of concerns and promotes cleaner code organization.
