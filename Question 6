Explain the difference between the RequestDispatcher.forward() and HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect() methods?


RequestDispatcher.forward() and HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect() are two different methods used for request forwarding and redirection in a servlet.

RequestDispatcher.forward():

This method is used for request forwarding to another resource (servlet or JSP) within the same web application on the server-side.
The request is transferred to the new resource, and the processing continues from there.
The client is unaware of the original servlet from where the request was forwarded.
It is commonly used to chain multiple servlets or JSP pages for processing different stages of a request.
HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect():

This method is used for redirection to a new URL, which may or may not be part of the same web application.
The server sends an HTTP response with the status code 302 (Found) or 303 (See Other) to instruct the client to send a new request to the specified URL.
The client's browser handles the redirection by making a new request to the specified URL.
The client knows about the new URL to which it has been redirected.
